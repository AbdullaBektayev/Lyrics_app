This project will help the people to study English with song.

How it works?

You will chose the song and fill up the song and artist input place in main page. After that if your song's lyrics exist they will show up on Recently songs column. You can go to the lyrics by clicking 'see lyrics' button, then there will be opened lyrics page, and if you don't know some of the words just click on it and they will appear on your Vocabulary page with translation to Russian . Also after studying words you can just remove from list or repeat by moving those words to the top of list.
